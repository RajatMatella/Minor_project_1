# Minor_project_1
Analysis of various implementations of Travelling Salesman Problem

The project includes 4 most significant impementations/approaches of TSP. These are:-
1) Naive/Brute force
2) Dynamic programming
3) Branch and Bound
4) Genetic algorithm

This project allows user to test the performance of any of these algorithm on a data set that can either be provided by the user or can be generated using our own tsp_matrix_generate.cpp program. Performance is measured in terms of time complexity and runtime.
